/*
ppm.go - PPM for IR

Might work exactly the same as though connected to a regular PPM radio receiver.

Note, with a carrier of 38kHz, the most graduations you get per channel is 38, slightly
more than 5 bits worth. This is because ppm uses a 1ms to 2ms pulse per channel and
1ms * 38kHz = 38.

So, fairly limited, but still pretty good.

If using to drive a 180 degree servo, that means each graduation is 4.7 degrees (180/38).


## Example

    const irPin = machine.GPIOX
    ppm := irrx.PPM()
    rx := irrx.NewRxDevice(irPin, ppm)
    rx.Start()

    for {
        X := float32(ppm.Channel(0)-1500)/500
        // X ranges from -1 to 1
        servo.Set(X)
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
